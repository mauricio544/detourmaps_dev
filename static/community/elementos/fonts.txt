Detour’s printed map is a way to have everything there is to know about the community in the palm of your hand. With 2 publications each year for each community and over 40,000 maps distributed you will be well informed with our printed maps. Inside the printed maps include a map of the community with different local business advertisements. The map pin points each business giving the user a better idea of where the business or resource is located in the community. We do not just have business locations on the map; we also have locations of parks, bus routes, schools, useful phone numbers, events and basically all public assets in the community.  The printed map also is color coded so that residents may know which business is participating in the $10 Savings Card promotion.

history-text
Detour Community MAPs (a Marketing and Advertising Platform) is a division of Entire Marketing Group LLC established in 2007. The division was created to help the development of different communities in Illinois. We strive on connecting resident with local businesses and organizations to better the community by creating a SHOP LOCAL campaign. 

This campaign encourages residents to shop local versus shopping at a corporate or chain store. Resources suggest that for each dollar you spend at an independent business in your community, three or more times goes back into the local economy compared to a dollar spent at retailer owned by a chain. This means better school, security, resources, and an overall better community.

mision-text
Detour Maps is committed to help neighborhoods and organizations of all Industries, sizes and locations by personalizing the organization’s branding so their residents can recognize them. When you partner with us, we help by using a simple and easy advertising platform whether it is print advertisement or adding your community to our online directory (examples SSA3 “Greater Southwest Development Corporation”). 

We help the businesses of the local organization to have the opportunity to advertise collectively and share the cost. We will work with you so you do not have to worry about “ARTvertising” (branding your neighborhood with promotions) your community.
